# 🚀 FPV Drone Rush  
   
**FPV Drone Rush** is the **first fully on-chain FPV racing simulator** built with Solidity. Compete in drone races, manage your energy, pass checkpoints, and be the first to reach the finish line — all on Ethereum.

## 🎮 Gameplay     
 
- Players register their drones before the race starts.  
- Each drone has **100 energy points**.    
- Every step forward **costs 10 energy** and moves you to the next checkpoint.   
- There are **5 total checkpoints**.  
- The **first player to finish all checkpoints** wins the race!

## ⚙️ Smart Contract Features  

- ✅ On-chain drone registration 
- 🔋 Energy management system  
- 🏁 Checkpoint tracking     
- 👑 Automatic winner detection
- 🛑 Race locking mechanism once started

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Players call `register()` to enter the race.
2. When ready, someone calls `startRace()` to lock in players and begin.   
3. Players take steps using `step()` to move through checkpoints.
4. Energy is consumed with each step.
5. The first to reach **checkpoint 5** is declared the winner.

## 🧪 Example

```solidity
register();   // Join the race
startRace();  // Start the race
step();       // Move to checkpoint 1
step();       // Move to checkpoint 2
...
